# social_imaging_scripts

Utilities and notebooks for the social imaging pipeline. The repository is in
the middle of a refactor to standardise preprocessing, registration, and ROI
handling across animals.

## Documentation quick links

- [Metadata Entry Workflow](wiki/metadata_entry_workflow.md) â€“ how to record new
  animals and sessions in the Excel workbook before running the pipeline.

Additional wiki pages can live under the `wiki/` folder; add links here as they
appear so newcomers can discover them from the repository front page.
